Questions:
1.
2. It would make sense for ShoppingCart to extend Inventory as the shopping cart can just use the Inventories quantity methods to increase the quantity of products in the shopping cart.
3. As you cannot use multiple inheritances, with composition you can have more functionality. Its also easier to modify later by changing behavior of methods. Able to reuse code without an is - a association. Better encapsulation.
4. Using inheritance you can define a class by using a different class which can make creating that class easier and it also lets us reuse code.
