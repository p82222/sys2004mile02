Questions:
1. The relationship between StoreView and StoreManager is that of association as they use each other’s objects and methods.
2. The shopping cart class does not need to extend inventory if the product class extends inventory as you can call the product which makes sense since it’s the thing getting put into the cart and call any inventory methods through the product class.
3. As you cannot use multiple inheritances, with composition you can have more functionality. Its also easier to modify later by changing behavior of methods. Able to reuse code without an is - a association. Better encapsulation.
4. Using inheritance you can define a class by using a different class which can make creating that class easier and it also lets us reuse code.
